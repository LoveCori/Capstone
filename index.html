    <h1>Retro Games Worth Playing</h1>
</header>
<body>
    <p>When I was 10 years old my cousin bought us our very first gaming system. It was a Nintendo Gaming System. It came with three games, a gun, two controllers, and the console. It was my first journey into gaming. In my opinion I still love playing retro games over more modern games. My top Nintendo Games are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Super Mario Bros.</li>
        <li>Donkey Kong</li>
        <li>Duck Hunt</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When I play these retro games today I feel the nostalgia set in. It brings me back to being a child and playing with my siblings. My older sister was such a wiz when it came to playing these games. She had a calm and patient demeanor; whereas, I would get excited and jump around. I began watching her play more and more. It enabled me to calm myself down to go through each of the levels and finish the games. </p>
